# CollaborationExample
A short example of how to collaborate using Github.

This project does not serve any purpose other than to show each of the students on the current course how to use Github together.

They will each be tasked with creating their own activity and pushing it to the project.

All the calls will be handled in the MainActivity with buttons directing to each of the learners activity pages.

Should be fun and give the learners a chance to get hands on with Github using Android Studio.
